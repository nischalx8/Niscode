# Two Sum

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices `i` and `j` such that `nums[i] + nums[j] == target` and `i != j`.

You may assume that every input has exactly one pair of indices `i` and `j` that satisfy the condition.

Return the answer with the smaller index first.

## Example 1:

**Input:**  
`nums = [3,4,5,6]`, `target = 7`

**Output:**  
`[0,1]`  
**Explanation:** `nums[0] + nums[1] == 7`, so we return `[0, 1]`.

## Example 2:

**Input:**  
`nums = [4,5,6]`, `target = 10`

**Output:**  
`[0,2]`

## Example 3:

**Input:**  
`nums = [5,5]`, `target = 10`

**Output:**  
`[0,1]`

## Constraints:

- `2 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-10,000,000 <= nums[i] <= 10,000,000`
- `-10,000,000 <= target <= 10,000,000`

<summary>Recommended Time & Space Complexity</summary>

You should aim for a solution with **O(n)** time and **O(n)** space, where n is the size of the input array.

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

A brute force solution would be to check every pair of numbers in the array. This would be an **O(nÂ²)** solution. Can you think of a better way? Maybe in terms of mathematical equation?

</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

Given, we need to find indices `i` and `j` such that `i != j` and `nums[i] + nums[j] == target`. Can you rearrange the equation and try to fix any index to iterate on?

</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>

We can iterate through `nums` with index `i`. Let `difference = target - nums[i]` and check if `difference` exists in the hash map as we iterate through the array, else store the current element in the hashmap with its index and continue. We use a hashmap for **O(1)** lookups.
